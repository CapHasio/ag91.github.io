<h1>More enjoyable estimates, or how to share security knowledge with your team</h1>

Make a dashboard, split it by size and security risk, and let your
team place stories in the right areas of the dashboard. It takes at
most five minutes and you can estimate without boredom.
</p>

<h2 id="org60342d5">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org60342d5">
<p>
Estimates are always wrong. People feel uncomfortable in defining a
time for their tasks because often others will take that as a
schedule. The <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile movement</a> came up with attempts to make this
activity enjoyable and insightful (think of <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/planning-poker">Planning Poker</a> or <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/estimating-with-tee-shirt-sizes">T-shirt
sizing</a>). Most of what I read tackled how to quantify the effort needed
for a story.
</p>

<p>
Now, effort is not the only thing worth estimating. As I mentioned <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/08/14/linux-unix-philosophy-and-why-programs-are-just-filters/">in
my post "Linux, Unix Philosophy and why programs are just filters"</a>,
people are data creators. Sometimes this data is confidential. When
you offer a service to other people, they will create data and you
will have to deal with that assuming that need to stay confidential.
Assuming our existing service handles data securely, we would like to
avoid to make it insecure when we extend it. So, security risk is
something engineers need to be aware of and ideally estimate.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org1ec9f4e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1ec9f4e">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1ec9f4e">
<p>
Estimating security is difficult. <a href="https://threatmodeler.com/threat-modeling-methodologies-overview-for-your-business/">There are several approaches</a> and
they always require checklists and lengthy data flow modelling. I
believe some of these practices happen too infrequently and, if not,
they are prone to become boring ceremonies. I believe that security
(and also monitoring, but lets leave this out for now) should be part
of story planning. It is also disturbing that engineers do not have a
taste for security issues: if not us, who else could protect users'
confidentiality?
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org7e1bf9c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7e1bf9c">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7e1bf9c">
<p>
Recently I had the privilege of collaborating with the smart people of
<a href="https://dmrs1v41ia0sr.cloudfront.net/">QWAN</a>, and they suggested a simple way to take away the boredom of
estimating effort: just make a dashboard, split it by story size
(similar to T-shirt sizing: Small, Large, Extra Large), and let
everybody in the team place stories in the right area. If somebody
strongly believe that a story is of a different size, they will point
it out and the team can debate about it. Shortly this became our
default approach to estimate stories.
</p>

<p>
After seeing how effective and efficient this simple method was, I
thought: "What about approaching security the same way?". Here my
proposal: let's make our dashboard a matrix where we also have a risk
size.
</p>

<p>
This is a sample dashboard I am thinking of:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/blog/2020/08/22/more-enjoyable-estimates-or-how-to-share-security-knowledge-with-your-team/boardEmpty.jpg" alt="boardEmpty.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Story size (or complexity) stands for how difficult is to implement a
feature. Security stands for how likely this will break
confidentiality.
</p>

<p>
I also like that teams customize the dashboard a little, this is what
I would do for making it more familiar to me (I think it also
increases efficiency in recognizing where to place things):
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/blog/2020/08/22/more-enjoyable-estimates-or-how-to-share-security-knowledge-with-your-team/boardEmptyWithPics.jpg" alt="boardEmptyWithPics.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
What I propose is that given a backlog of stories, the team members
will concurrently move them in the right areas. For example:
</p>



<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/assets/blog/2020/08/22/more-enjoyable-estimates-or-how-to-share-security-knowledge-with-your-team/boardUseExample.jpg" alt="boardUseExample.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
In the example above, the team estimated that changing static text is
simple and has no effect on user's security. Instead they estimated
that opening an internal API to the public is of average complexity,
but it risks to expose users' confidential data.
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Important note: the point of this method is the debate within the
team.</span> The main benefit of any effort estimation is to refine our
understanding of the effort itself (think of "grokking the effort" if
you enjoyed the sci-fi book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land">"Stranger in a Strange Land"</a>). Also in
this case, the main benefit of estimating security is the generated
debate about security topics: imagine a team member positioning the
"opening API to public" into the "Safe" area; now another colleague
will move that story into the "Horror" area; ideally the first will
ask the latter why and this will trigger knowledge sharing about
security risks and concerns.
</p>

<p>
I propose that this approach can make visible the security concerns of
user stories. 
</p>

<p>
I envision that a business could use security estimates to roughly
calculate the risk a company is taking at every iteration, and take
decisions accordingly. Although this is just a wild guess because
these estimates are subjective to the team, and so likely unreliable
(but all estimates are like that).

<h2 id="org48fb470">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org48fb470">
<p>
So the steps are easy, make a dashboard, split it by size and risk,
take your backlog of stories/tasks and ask your team to put it in the
right area of your dashboard. We need more security awareness and
knowledge sharing and we may make that happen through effective
security estimates.

The software I used for making this example board is <a href="https://miro.com/">Miro</a>, which I
found quite enjoyable to use and helpful for remote collaboration.
