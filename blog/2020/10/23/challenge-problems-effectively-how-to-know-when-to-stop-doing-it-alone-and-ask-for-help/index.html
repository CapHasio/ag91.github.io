<h1>Challenge problems effectively: how to know when to stop doing it alone and ask for help</h1>
<div id="outline-container-org1e95668" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1e95668">Prologue</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1e95668">
<p>
In the busyness of a working week it totally went unnoticed that two
of my closest colleagues were interchangeably banging their heads
against a somewhat hard problem. I love the noise cancelling feature
of remote working, but this time backfired: I missed the rhythm of
neural incandescent work.
</p>

<p>
At some point they told me that they found a way out, although the
cause of the problem is still unknown. And they told me about their
running around in circles for a couple of days.
</p>

<p>
Innocently, I told them that I use a heuristic in these cases (a
self-developed one I believe, although I read a lot - so who knows
where I got that from?).
</p>

<p>
Since they quietly listened to my explanation for about five minutes,
I guess it may be less obvious than I thought. So here I am sharing my
five minutes with a bigger audience.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org237b914" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org237b914">Not enough time for all problems</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org237b914">
<p>
Let's assume that you have fun solving problems. Now let's say you
encounter one that you cannot solve immediately: you will likely go in
frenzy mode and loop over this problem until you win over it. The
little adrenaline boost surely makes you feel happy and you totally
forget the unrecoverable time you invested.
</p>

<p>
Remember: time is a precious and unrecoverable resource. To make this
even clearer: if you are a chocolate lover, the neuronal time you
invest onto a problem is taken away forever from feeling the
marvellous sweet melting in your mouth.
</p>

<p>
Now the big underlying issue is that each of us is a problem
generator: if you have an agenda, you have material evidence. Then we
live in a society and that is a problem generator itself (remember tax
declaration?), so, well you get the idea: there is an ever growing
ocean of problems available to you 24/7.
</p>

<p>
And we only have about a century to live when lucky.
</p>

<p>
We need to decide how to allocate our finite resources, i.e. cut out
some problems!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org98b546a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org98b546a">Not everything is lost</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org98b546a">
<p>
Another important bit of information to navigate the aforementioned
ocean safely: together we achieve amazing things!
</p>

<p>
Problems that are hard to tackle on our own become simple(r) with a bit
of organization. Actually, as <a href="20200425191831-domenico_de_masi.html">Domenico De Masi</a> writes in his book <a href="20200525172817-il_lavoro_nel_xxi_secolo.html">Il
lavoro nel XXI secolo</a>, <a href="20200525180537-management_is_about_achieving_things_that_only_a_genius_may_do_alone_but_with_normal_people.html">management is about achieving with normal means
the things which only a genius may do alone</a>.
</p>

<p>
And if you work in a company (with staff &gt; 1) you should remember very
well that you are not alone!
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4d397e2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4d397e2">How I do it</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4d397e2">
<p>
I work as a software engineer, which means a problem solver applied to
computer software and some domain.
</p>

<p>
Most often I have to pick up problems that I would rather skip
altogether. Most seldom a problem jumps at me and puts me in a crisis:
this is the best kind of problems, the ones that transform me and make
me a better person.
</p>

<p>
For the first kind I find inconvenient to spend more than a few hours
of work, while I am happy to spend longer meditations for the latter
kind.
</p>

<p>
So how do I decide?
</p>

<p>
I keep it easy and split problems in two kinds: problems I have to
solve to progress a task and problems whose solutions I expect will
taint my career/personal growth forever. How you distinguish between
them is personal, and in the following I share my own way of doing
things.
</p>

<p>
Let me give examples of what I mean to be clear:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Finding out why the Scala/TypeScript type system is complaining?
</p>

<p>
Clearly just a task I need to solve to progress.
</p></li>

<li><p>
There is a production issue?
</p>

<p>
Still task to progress.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Did the team send the PO with a buggy product to the client?
</p>

<p>
Hard problem, if I solve this I can at least make my PO enjoy her
work more and ideally learn how to become a more reliable person in
general.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Find a way to keep colleagues excited about what they do and help
them be successful?
</p>

<p>
Definitely a hard problem and rewarding/reusable in any context I
can think of!
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
At the stage of the career path I am in, I feel most of technical
issues end up in the "task to progress" category, while people issues
fall in the "personal growth" one. This really depends on <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/09/26/life-is-short-but-not-short-enough-to-skip-planning">the vision
you developed for yourself</a> (i.e., a type system researcher could care
more about the first example I mention than me).
</p>

<p>
<b>About the "task to progress"</b>: they MUST have a short time box and
you cannot spend more than a couple of hours banging your head on
them. There is an ocean of problems, remember? And... you are not
alone! No matter how experienced you are: ask for help (_AFTER_ the
time-box).
</p>

<p>
The idea is that you are most likely surrounded by smart people and
after you struggled enough to get a good understanding of the problem,
you are capable of describing it well enough to them. A lot of time if
you formulate the question before asking it, you will find out another
clue to the solution: so I suggest to start from formulating the best
question you could do to your senior.
</p>

<p>
If nothing works, ask that question and they can help you filling the
holes in your understanding and progress quicker than if you started
spending hours by yourself.
</p>

<p>
To summarize: time-box tasks blocking progress (in general no more
than 3 hours) and then ask for help.
</p>

<p>
<b>About the "personal growth" problems</b>: they deserve most of your time and
thinking. They need your own answers because usually for these there
are no silver bullets (but some people have the hubris to advertise
their local solutions as general solutions...). I usually exchange
ideas with others about these problems in person or by reading and it
is always an enriching experience: you really may have disregarded the
unique miracle that has a working (any kind really) of relation with
you.
</p>

<p>
Most of my work, and I expect yours as well if you are a software
engineer, belong to the first category. I deal with the big problems
in the background or by directly asking support of my mentors (for
engineering I had luck looking <a href="https://codingcoach.io/">here</a>).

<h2 id="orgfb16229">Epilogue</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfb16229">
<p>
The colleagues keep doing some banging, but at the same time the chat
channel seems more active... who knows, maybe the little speech
worked?
</p>

<p>
I hope you will save some hours with this few minutes read. More so, I
hope you will put work in recognizing the problems most significant to
you and invest wealthily on those. I really wish you spend your time
in the best way: it really is precious!
</p>

<p>
Have fun and you MUST make your dreams happen!
