<h1>Slow Growth, Insomnia and Curing Symptoms</h1>
<p>
There are moments in your life when, as a colleague would say, a bunch
of scattered dots becomes a cheetah. That is to say that all of a
sudden a pattern emerges and you can define it. And as Tom DeMarco
said in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123715.Slack">Slack</a>: when you learn something that is significant
for you, your first reaction is to panic.
</p>

<p>
I guess today I panicked.
</p>

<p>
It started while I found myself in a project proposal about inducing
insomniacs to sleep by using digital screens. James Lech, this smart
scientist from South Africa, is dedicating his time into exploiting
light to influence people behavior. In a gist (my understanding of)
the idea is that you press a button and the screen on which you are
watching a movie starts flickering in an imperceptible way, slowly and
implicitly bringing you in the arms of Morpheus.
</p>

<p>
And while we were debating the ethical concerns of this, my brain
slowed down and gave an order to information it gathered so far.
</p>

<p>
Oh my, panic! We need to slow down. And for we, I mean the whole circus. 
</p>

<p>
The main pain point that started the thought is: why are we trying to
put people to sleep in the first place? In the worst case scenario,
they have a persistent disorder. I know something about mental
illnesses, and in my experience I can tell you: it is just disorder.
Returning to health requires you to look at the mess, accept the mess,
and to take the painful but <b>insightful</b> journey of ordering the mess.
Ideally you need a shoulder on which to cry while doing this.
</p>

<p>
Note: the insightful part is fundamental to avoid making a mess again.
I humbly believe this applies to burnout as it applies to sleep. And
the point that everybody gets lost at is the observation bit. In
permaculture literature observation is key: you cannot change an
ecological system without understanding it, and you cannot understand
it without quietly and patiently looking at it (look at the work by
Donella H. Meadows for good foundations in system thinking).
</p>

<p>
Now, in my experience observing yourself is more difficult than
observing a garden and seeing where those unwelcome slugs that love
your salad come from. Observing how your current self is making you
insomniac/burnt out/unhappy is a ugly self-discovery experience. Who
wants to say I am imperfect? Well, apart from Gilberto Freyre who
stated: "If it depended on me, I would never be ripe, nor in the ideas
nor in the style, but always green, uncomplished, always
experimental".
</p>

<p>
People take the pill instead. The easy way out is doing more of the
same and when the body~spirit is painful just give it a palliative
(e.g., a pill/coke/light). That is blinding yourself and accumulating
extra damage. That is what the subpar leaders end up doing when they
surround themselves of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Man_(film)">'yes'-men</a>. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_to_Great">Good to Great</a> Jim C. Collins
explains that great leaders work on facts no matter how painful those
sound. I want to be a great leader of my body and spirit. Bare, cruel
facts give you visibility and open prospects to action. First accept
the facts and then try to understand them, maybe act on them. This is
lengthy. But what else have you better to do? I mean what else than to
care about yourself?
</p>

<p>
That question sparked the memory of the label on the seat in front of
you that your hostess gently invites you to look at before the flight
starts: the adults put the inflatable jacket on themselves <b>before</b>
the children. Once they can protect themselves they are in the
position of taking care of others. It is on the label; it is
mandatory; it makes common sense. It also applies to your well being.
</p>

<p>
Society/companies/schools are requiring people to keep going with
whatever they do no matter the pain they feel. They are also making
the pain people feel something that lowers their status and so
something to hide. <b>And</b> they are <span class="underline">demanding</span> to do this more
efficiently. Mental health issues are <b>normal</b> because we are walking
wonders (consider just how amazing it is that your eyes can perceive
this text and you can make sense of words!) but we are still so
fragile. As Scott Alexander says in his <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Meditations On Moloch</a>:
"Competition and optimization are blind idiotic processes and they
fully intend to deny us even one lousy galaxy". I want to get to the
end of my life and say "I really explored myself" as Carol S. Dweck
tells an old lady said in her book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40745.Mindset">Mindset</a>. I would despise to say: "I
wasted my life, but in the most efficient way".
</p>

<p>
This reminds me of the urge I felt of hiding in a Tibetan monastery
for a year when I heard people deciding that young people lives where
more valuable than old people's ones during the COVID-19: I really
wanted extra time to explore myself in depth and find out how blind I
am myself to the enormous value elders have to offer to our society.
</p>

<p>
This is what I mean by slowing down the whole circus: we need time to
understand ourselves and our evolving community. Someone would think
life is too short for that. Bertrand Russell wrote: "Most men would
rather die, than think. Many do". I am fine with that, but I would
like to shape a society that encourages you to think, to take your
time, and to address issues together with some like-minded person. If
you want to rush, work 120-hours weeks like Elon Musk, and burn like a
flame, you are free to do so. I would find it surprising if that is
the desire of the majority. In any case I demand to be in charge of my
time and for the "normality" stereotype to be a healthy one. One that
paves the road for sustainable growth, not rushed consumption.
</p>

<p>
This was my 'panic' experience. I saw in a moment that as a society we
are causing our own pain and focusing on efficiently curing the
symptoms of this. Instead, let's slowly learn about ourselves and,
once we are ready, about the others.
</p>

<p>
P.S.: if you suffer insomnia due to anxiety, please try what Jane
McGonigal suggests in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611964-superbetter?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=11NGNd7C0C&amp;rank=1">SuperBetter</a>: "As soon as you feel your nerves,
say "I'm excited" or "Get excited!" to yourself. Out loud. Say it a
few times. "I'm excited". "Get excited!"". Apparently anxiety and
excitement are the same thing in the brain, and you can easily
exchange the one for the other with a bit of "mind-fu".
