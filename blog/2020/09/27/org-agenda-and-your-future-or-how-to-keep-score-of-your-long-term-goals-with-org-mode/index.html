<h1>Org Agenda and Your Future, or how to keep score of your long term goals with Org Mode</h1>

<div id="outline-container-org9225e6c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9225e6c">Too long; didn't read</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9225e6c">
<p>
Here I show how to leverage Org mode to define long term goals and
more importantly how to track your progress towards reaching your
vision. In short a mix of tags, Org Agenda filters, Org Archive and
<a href="https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql">org-ql</a>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org453038f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org453038f">The problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org453038f">
<p>
Successful people choose daily tasks by thinking about the effect
these have on their future. And effective people create a feedback
loop that makes them excited about their progress.
</p>

<p>
Progress -&gt; excitement -&gt; more progress.
</p>

<p>
So I wondered: how can I make my Org todo lists help me with my long
term goals in a structured manner?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbd939a1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbd939a1">It is a problem indeed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbd939a1">
<p>
Well <a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/09/26/life-is-short-but-not-short-enough-to-skip-planning">I dedicate a whole post on the importance of a vision and how to
pick a good one</a>. In the same post I also explain how planning becomes
more precise the closer the tasks get to the present moment. Now Org
supports task lists, supports stats via <a href="https://github.com/alphapapa">alphapapa</a>'s org-ql, and
supports customizable views of headings through the Agenda. I really
missed a way to transform Org from a simple todo list manager in a
long-term goals manager.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgea0d41b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgea0d41b">And there is a solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgea0d41b">
<p>
So I created my own approach! In a talk by John Wiegley I saw how he
alters his agenda according to where he is: for example, if he cannot
ping the Internet his agenda will exclude tasks that require
networking. He does this through tags and agenda filters. That kick
started my thinking process: what about marking tasks by their
importance on my immediate, medium-term and long-term goals?
</p>

<p>
So I came up with tags that look like:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">:0yr:, :5yr:, :10yr:, :20yr:
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In my mind these represent the number of years I believe accomplishing
this tasks will affect.
</p>

<p>
I could say that I started with writing down a vision first, but
well... I am a coder! And, indeed, I just started playing with the Org
Agenda customization.
</p>

<p>
My goal: seeing tasks with <code>:20yr:</code> appear at the top of my agenda and
those with <code>:0yr:</code> at the bottom. Let's see how to hack it.
</p>

<p>
The variable <code>org-agenda-sorting-strategy</code> defines in what order the
Org Agenda view displays tasks (kudos to Org developers to leave this
open to extension!). So if you want to order by a tag, all you need to
do is to add a <code>org-agenda-cmp-user-defined</code> comparison and apply it
to the strategy variable. Well it is easier to show:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(defun my/org-agenda-sort-longterm-tags (el1 el2)
  "Prioritize agenda items EL1 and EL2 that contains tags in the form :[0-9]yr: relatively to the number of years."
  (let* ((regex ":\\([0-9]+\\)yr:")
         (years-el1 (progn
                      ;; this can fail because the regex is not found or there is no tag for :Xyr:, so I am handling with the zeros
                      (if (string-match regex el1)
                          (string-to-number (or (match-string 1 el1) "0"))
                        0)))
         (years-el2 (progn
                      (if (string-match regex el2)
                          (string-to-number (or (match-string 1 el2) "0"))
                        0))
                    ))
    ;; TODO I am sure there is a cleaner way to implement this comparison...
    (if (&gt; years-el1 years-el2)
        1
      (if (&gt; years-el2 years-el1)
          -1
        nil))))

(setq org-agenda-cmp-user-defined 'my/org-agenda-sort-longterm-tags)

(setq org-agenda-sorting-strategy
      '((agenda habit-down time-up user-defined-down priority-down category-keep)
        (todo priority-down category-keep)
        (tags priority-down category-keep)
        (search category-keep)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In the above <code>my/org-agenda-sort-longterm-tags</code> compares tags so that
<code>:20yr: &gt; :10yr:</code> and <code>:10yr: &lt; :20yr:</code> and <code>:20yr: = :20yr:</code> (the
compare operator in programming languages typically returns positive,
negative and zero integers to reflect these cases). The other
important bits are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<code>(setq org-agenda-cmp-user-defined 'my/org-agenda-sort-longterm-tags)</code>
</p>

<p>
this make my comparison operator available
</p></li>

<li><p>
<code>user-defined-down</code>
</p>

<p>
this activates my comparison in the agenda.
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>
At this point I needed to define my vision. This took much longer than
my programming, and in part is still a work in progress. (The bit I am
proud of is the statement "I am the catalyzer of sustainable
improvements that include as many people as possible", because it
keeps staying the same and guiding me in challenging moments.)
</p>

<p>
What I think you will find more interesting <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> is that I ended up splitting my Org files to represent the
goals I want to achieve, and more importantly defining Org Capture
templates that allowed me to define the kind of tag I described above
(<a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/07/28/how-to-integrate-yasnippet-and-yankpad-with-org-capture/">I use my templating extension to make this easy to maintain for
myself</a>).
</p>

<p>
An minimal example of Yankpad template you can use with this approach
is:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-text">\* TODO $1 :${2:$$(yas-choose-value (list "0yr" "5yr" "10yr" "20yr"))}:
  SCHEDULED: %t
See: %a
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Each of these files has a category (this means that my Org file starts
with a property line <code>#+CATEGORY: Some Vision</code>) that nicely display in
the agenda: so I can quickly see both the kind of vision I am
targeting (through the category) and the weight it has on my future
(through the tag).
</p>

<p>
Finally some metrics for setting up a feedback loop. Because we said
that we want to get excitement for our progress, right? Right. So, I
looked into org-ql. That again is a mode that I always wanted to use,
but I did not know for what. I found out it is great to do weekly
reviews of my achievements. I have a periodic task in my agenda with
source blocks that look like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(let ((files (concatenate 'list (org-agenda-files) (list "my.org_archive"))))
  (--&gt;
   (my/get-stats-tasks "DONE" -31 nil  nil files)
   (s-concat 
    "\n"
    (format "Tasks marked DONE last month (today is: %s): %s\n" (current-time-string) it)
    (format "    Tasks done last month (%s) with category\n\n" (current-time-string))
    (format "    Vision1  %s\n" (my/get-stats-tasks "DONE" -31 nil nil files "Category1"))
    (format "    Vision2  %s\n" (my/get-stats-tasks "DONE" -31 nil nil files "Category2"))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Note: I am also using my <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Archiving.html">archive</a> for retrieving done tasks! Archiving
removes clutter from my files, so they feel clean and compact when I
look at them.
</p>

<p>
The <code>my/get-stats-tasks</code> function retrieves the necessary statistics
(this is just a wrapper around the org-ql query API):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(defun my/get-stats-tasks (todo-tag from &amp;optional tag to files category)
  "Get stats for tasks of last week with TODO-TAG TAG FROM optionally define TO date and source FILES to use."
  (let ((tasks
         (org-ql-query
           :from (or files (org-agenda-files))
           :where
           `(and (todo ,todo-tag)
                 (if ,tag (tags ,tag) t)
                 (if ,category (category ,category) t)
                 (ts :from ,from :to ,(or to 'today))))))
    `((tasks . ,(length tasks))
      (tasks-per-day . ,(/ (length tasks) (abs from))))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
With this approach I am a C-c C-c away from my feedback loop, and I
can monitor where I am spending more effort and adjust if needed.
</p>


<p>
By the way, I am using this system from a while and... I am totally
not so precise: often I get the task category wrong or I estimate
wrongly the effect of the tasks on my future. I find this effort
valuable in orienting me towards keeping track of these things.
</p>

<p>
So please be forgiving with yourself if you are planning on using a
similar strategy.

<p>
Focusing your energies on what you want to happen is important. Life
is short so I believe we cannot run after all that is attractive, if
we want to be effective. So if you take a single thing from this post:
develop a vision, and let it guide you through your future. Then help
yourself with your tools, Org mode and Emacs in general are amazing
instruments if you tame them.
