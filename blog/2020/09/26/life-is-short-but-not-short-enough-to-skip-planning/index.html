<h1>Life is short. But not short enough to skip planning</h1>

<p>
Life is short. Sometimes the news make us feel that even getting to
tomorrow is uncertain. Well, the future does not exist, right? We may
as well focus on the present and enjoy ourselves in an Epicurean way,
shall we not? I guess it is time to discover how planning to reach a
desired future helps you have a better present.
</p>

<p>
Let's start from decision fatigue. Imagine your brain like a battery
(<a href="https://knowingneurons.com/2012/12/14/brain-battery/">apparently it is actually a thing</a>). Any conscious decision you take
lowers its charge.
</p>

<p>
Now think I put you in a labyrinth with traps: any time you choose a
direction or you avoid a trap you consume a unit of energy. If your
brain does not have enough energy to deal with both directions and
traps you cannot exit the labyrinth. If this remembers you of your
Friday afternoon, <span class="underline">it is not a coincidence</span>. And decision fatigue
affects everything: from your boss deciding to give a raise to your
slacking colleague, to you ruining your diet with a fast food over a
slow food.
</p>

<p>
But: what if you decide at the beginning to always go right? Now, you
have lost a unit of energy at the start of your journey, but the rest
of your energy is available to deal with traps. And you may have even
enough energy to find a better strategy to deal with directions.
</p>

<p>
Planning is deciding a strategy in advance. The main aim of planning
is discarding possibilities \a priori\ so that you can invest your
decision energy on the important and unexpected things.
</p>

<p>
Planning can happen at multiple levels of granularity: if you want to
define how to spend the next minute of your life, chances are you can
be extremely more precise than defining exactly what you are going to
be doing in 10 years from now.
</p>

<p>
Short term planning is an art in itself. The insightful book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114603-work-clean">Work
Clean The life-changing power of mise-en-place by Dan Charnas</a> makes
this crystal clear: the best chefs plan backwards. Planning backwards
means to imagine a perfectly served dish and reconstruct all the
actions that bring you from there to where you are now.
</p>

<p>
The problem in planning long term is that you lack information and
context. Planning backwards with a 10 years resolution is still
useful, but you need to make a lot of assumptions and most likely they
will fail to happen. <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
A long term plan should rather be a vision. A vision is the why you
carry on making short term plans and go to troubles to make them
happen. A vision is a major advantage, in the words of Darren Hardy
from his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9420697-the-compound-effect">The Compound Effect</a>: "The person who has a clear,
compelling, and white-hot burning why will always defeat even the best
of the best at doing the how".
</p>

<p>
A vision can be a simple but focused statement like: "You'll be third
graders soon!". That gave young pupils a new identity to strive for
and made them focus their energies on. This kind of clarity reduces
the actions you need to perform and increases their power. As a side
effect this creates what system theory calls feedback loops: you see
yourself a bit closer to your goal, you get excited, and you do more.
In general, this concept of having a clear why, before even discussing
what and how to do something, is so powerful that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA">Simon Sinek</a> focuses
his consulting career on making this enter people's heads.
</p>

<p>
Ideally, pick a big vision because just the fact that you will strive
for that new identity will make you feel proud.
</p>

<p>
If you ever need help at picking a satisfying vision for yourself, I
would suggest the three questions Tony Hsieh uses to judge actions on
the long term:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What would happen if everyone in the world would do this?</li>

<li>What would the world look like?</li>

<li>What would the net effect be on the overall happiness in the world?</li>
</ul>


<p>
Now, say you have a vision, and you know about backward planning: all
you are left with is defining milestones that you believe will make
you progress towards your vision. For this middle level planning I try
to follow the suggestions of a highly respected manager like Andrew S.
Grove: plan next year in the context of next 5 years and repeat next
year. This way your plans react to the context: sometimes they will
proceed faster and most often they will need a bit longer to succeed,
or even get restructured altogether.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://ag91.github.io/blog/2020/09/12/slow-growth-insomnia-and-curing-symptoms/">As I wrote about before</a>, finding a vision is the kind of activity that
can have huge impact on your life and so it takes all the time you
need (i.e., no scarcity/rushed thinking here!). As Dan Jorndt told
about his company: "We're a crawl, walk, run company". This means that
even successful companies take time to get their root system deep
enough to, then, solidly sustain the bulk of their enterprise. This is
even more true for the individual, and I believe what I read in a
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1474454">Hacker News comment</a>: "it's not just having the experience, the best
part may be the planning".
</p>

<p>
Life is always different from what you imagine. I guess that just
means we can enjoy it twice: in what we imagine it to be and in seeing
what actually comes out of the egg.
</p>

<p>
To conclude: we all have our labyrinths, from bringing food on the
table to finding a way to keep all our stakeholders happy, and a
limited set of mental energy. Let's use plan to get out of our
labyrinths. Possibly let's follow the lead of Scott Adams (a.k.a.,
Dilbert creator): "I wouldn't be satisfied simply escaping from my
prison of silence; I was planning to escape, free the other inmates,
shoot the warden, and burn down the prison".
