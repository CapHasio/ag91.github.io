#+DESCRIPTION: A rather long log of running through the Lacinia tutorial

This is my work through the very cool tutorial by [[https://github.com/walmartlabs/lacinia/tree/master/docs/tutorial][Howard Lewis Ship]].

Let's start!

The repo with the complete source is here:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/walmartlabs/clojure-game-geek
#+END_SRC

This is a project about board games and feedback.
First the template project

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
lein new lacinia-tutorial
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
Generating a project called lacinia-tutorial based on the 'default' template.
The default template is intended for library projects, not applications.
To see other templates (app, plugin, etc), try `lein help new`.
:END:

The project has to change slightly:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/project.clj
(defproject lacinia-tutorial "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write description"
  :url "http://example.com/FIXME"
  :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"
            :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.8.0"]
                 [com.walmartlabs/lacinia "0.21.0"]])

#+END_SRC

Lacinia uses third party libraries to parse the GraphQL schemas and
store in ordered maps.

Schemas have the edn format:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/resources/cgg-schema.edn
{:objects
 {:BoardGame
  {:description "A physical or virtual board game."
   :fields
   {:id {:type (non-null ID)} ;; ID is a GraphQL symbol and a Lacinia
                              ;; base type, the non-null bit is a
                              ;; Lacinia constraint: this is likely
                              ;; treated as clojure.spec
    :name {:type (non-null String)}
    :summary {:type String
              :description "A one-line summary of the game."}
    :description {:type String
                  :description "A long-form description of the game."}
    :min_players {:type Int ;; lacinia works only with underscores due to problems with clojure.spec
                  :description "The minimum number of players the game supports."}
    :max_players {:type Int
                  :description "The maximum number of players the game supports."}
    :play_time {:type Int
                :description "Play time, in minutes, for a typical game."}}}}

 :queries
 {:game_by_id
  {:type :BoardGame
   :description "Access a BoardGame by its unique id, if it exists."
   :args
   {:id {:type ID}}
   :resolve :query/game-by-id}}} ; this is the GraphQL query resolver
#+END_SRC

Now we need an interpreter:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/src/lacinia_tutorial/schema.clj
(ns lacinia-tutorial.schema
  "Contains custom resolvers and a function to provide the full schema."
  (:require
    [clojure.java.io :as io]
    [com.walmartlabs.lacinia.util :as util]
    [com.walmartlabs.lacinia.schema :as schema]
    [clojure.edn :as edn]))

(defn resolver-map
  []
  {:query/game-by-id (fn [context args value] ;; this is our resolver implementation
                       nil)})

(defn load-schema
  []
  (-> (io/resource "cgg-schema.edn") ;; load text from resource directory
      slurp
      edn/read-string ;; get the data as a clojure object
      (util/attach-resolvers (resolver-map)) ;; apply the resolver
      schema/compile)) ;; this should produce the GraphQL api?

#+END_SRC

For REPL development it can be useful to setup the =user= namespace:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/dev-resources/user.clj
(ns user
  (:require
    [lacinia-tutorial.schema :as s]
    [com.walmartlabs.lacinia :as lacinia]))

(def schema (s/load-schema))

(defn q
  [query-string]
  (lacinia/execute schema query-string nil nil)) ;; this is a quick
                                                 ;; way to query our
                                                 ;; GraphQL API
                                                 ;; without starting
                                                 ;; a server

#+END_SRC

This should now let us use the REPL:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :wrap "SRC clojure :noeval" :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/
(q "{ game_by_id(id: \"foo\") { id name summary }}")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :noeval
{:data #ordered/map ([:game_by_id nil])}
#+END_SRC

Naturally this resolves to empty because the resolver is programmed
so.

Let's now create some data that respect the schema:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/resources/cgg-data.edn
{:games
 [{:id "1234"
   :name "Zertz"
   :summary "Two player abstract with forced moves and shrinking board"
   :min_players 2
   :max_players 2
   }
  {:id "1235"
   :name "Dominion"
   :summary "Created the deck-building genre; zillions of expansions"
   :min_players 2}
  {:id "1236"
   :name "Tiny Epic Galaxies"
   :summary "Fast dice-based sci-fi space game with a bit of chaos"
   :min_players 1
   :max_players 4}
  {:id "1237"
   :name "7 Wonders: Duel"
   :summary "Tense, quick card game of developing civilizations"
   :min_players 2
   :max_players 2}]}
#+END_SRC 

And let's now use the data in the code:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/src/lacinia_tutorial/schema.clj
(ns lacinia-tutorial.schema
  "Contains custom resolvers and a function to provide the full schema."
  (:require
    [clojure.java.io :as io]
    [com.walmartlabs.lacinia.util :as util]
    [com.walmartlabs.lacinia.schema :as schema]
    [clojure.edn :as edn]))

(defn resolve-game-by-id
  [games-map context args value] ; the last 3 attributes are provided by the resolver
  (let [{:keys [id]} args]
    (get games-map id)))

(defn resolver-map
  []
  (let [cgg-data (-> (io/resource "cgg-data.edn")
                     slurp
                     edn/read-string)
        games-map (->> cgg-data
                       :games ; taking the games from the data
                       (reduce #(assoc %1 (:id %2) %2) {}))]
    {:query/game-by-id (partial resolve-game-by-id games-map)}))

(defn load-schema
  []
  (-> (io/resource "cgg-schema.edn") ;; load text from resource directory
      slurp
      edn/read-string ;; get the data as a clojure object
      (util/attach-resolvers (resolver-map)) ;; apply the resolver by substituting the :query keywords with the functions
      schema/compile)) ;; this should produce the GraphQL api?

#+END_SRC

Let's fix up our development file to use Clojure maps:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :mkdirp yes :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/dev-resources/user.clj
(ns user
  (:require
    [lacinia-tutorial.schema :as s]
    [com.walmartlabs.lacinia :as lacinia]
    [clojure.walk :as walk])
    (:import (clojure.lang IPersistentMap)))

(def schema (s/load-schema))

(defn simplify
  "Converts all ordered maps nested within the map into standard hash maps, and
   sequences into vectors, which makes for easier constants in the tests, and eliminates ordering problems."
  [m]
  (walk/postwalk
    (fn [node]
      (cond
        (instance? IPersistentMap node) (into {} node)
        (seq? node) (vec node)
        :else
        node))
    m))

(defn q
  [query-string]
  (-> (lacinia/execute schema query-string nil nil)
      simplify))
#+END_SRC

Now the query shows a normal map:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :wrap "SRC clojure :noeval" :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/
(use 'user :reload) ; to reload the user ns
(q "{ game_by_id(id: \"anything\") { id name summary }}")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :noeval
nil{:data {:game_by_id nil}}
#+END_SRC

And we can also do a query according to the data we have:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :wrap "SRC clojure :noeval" :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/
(use 'user :reload-all) ; to reload all the ns
(q "{ game_by_id(id: \"1237\") {name summary min_players max_players}}")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :noeval
nil{:data {:game_by_id {:name "7 Wonders: Duel", :summary "Tense, quick card game of developing civilizations", :min_players 2, :max_players 2}}}
#+END_SRC

Let's now add a field in the data we got:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/resources/cgg-data.edn
{:games
 [{:id "1234"
   :name "Zertz"
   :summary "Two player abstract with forced moves and shrinking board"
   :min_players 2
   :max_players 2
   :designers #{"200"}} ;; reference to the designer id. I think this is interpreted as a set of designer ids by the resolver
  {:id "1235"
   :name "Dominion"
   :summary "Created the deck-building genre; zillions of expansions"
   :designers #{"204"}
   :min_players 2}
  {:id "1236"
   :name "Tiny Epic Galaxies"
   :summary "Fast dice-based sci-fi space game with a bit of chaos"
   :designers #{"203"}
   :min_players 1
   :max_players 4}
  {:id "1237"
   :name "7 Wonders: Duel"
   :summary "Tense, quick card game of developing civilizations"
   :designers #{"201" "202"}
   :min_players 2
   :max_players 2}]

 :designers
 [{:id "200"
   :name "Kris Burm"
   :url "http://www.gipf.com/project_gipf/burm/burm.html"}
  {:id "201"
   :name "Antoine Bauza"
   :url "http://www.antoinebauza.fr/"}
  {:id "202"
   :name "Bruno Cathala"
   :url "http://www.brunocathala.com/"}
  {:id "203"
   :name "Scott Almes"}
  {:id "204"
   :name "Donald X. Vaccarino"}]}
#+END_SRC

By not doing anything the query on designers fails:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :wrap "SRC clojure :noeval" :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/
(use 'user :reload-all) ; to reload all the ns
(q "{ game_by_id(id: \"1237\") {designers}}")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :noeval
nil{:errors [{:message "Cannot query field `designers' on type `BoardGame'.", :query-path [:game_by_id], :locations [{:line 1, :column 25}], :field :designers, :type :BoardGame}]}
#+END_SRC

The reason is that our schema does not contain such data. No schema no
party:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/resources/cgg-schema.edn
{:objects
 {:BoardGame
  {:description "A physical or virtual board game."
   :fields
   {:id {:type (non-null ID)} ;; ID is a GraphQL symbol and a Lacinia
                              ;; base type, the non-null bit is a
                              ;; Lacinia constraint: this is likely
                              ;; treated as clojure.spec
    :name {:type (non-null String)}
    :summary {:type String
              :description "A one-line summary of the game."}
    :description {:type String
                  :description "A long-form description of the game."}
    :designers {:type (non-null (list ID)) 
                  :description "A long-form description of the game."}
    :min_players {:type Int ;; lacinia works only with underscores due to problems with clojure.spec
                  :description "The minimum number of players the game supports."}
    :max_players {:type Int
                  :description "The maximum number of players the game supports."}
    :play_time {:type Int
                :description "Play time, in minutes, for a typical game."}}}}

 :queries
 {:game_by_id
  {:type :BoardGame
   :description "Access a BoardGame by its unique id, if it exists."
   :args
   {:id {:type ID}}
   :resolve :query/game-by-id}}} ; this is the GraphQL query resolver

#+END_SRC

Now the query works:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :wrap "SRC clojure :noeval" :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/
(use 'user :reload-all) ; to reload all the ns
(q "{ game_by_id(id: \"1237\") {designers}}")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :noeval
nil{:data {:game_by_id {:designers ["201" "202"]}}}
#+END_SRC

However we want to interpret the ids to a designer object. Let's
change the schema again:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/resources/cgg-schema.edn
{:objects
 {:BoardGame
  {:description "A physical or virtual board game."
   :fields
   {:id {:type (non-null ID)}
    :name {:type (non-null String)}
    :summary {:type String
              :description "A one-line summary of the game."}
    :description {:type String
                  :description "A long-form description of the game."}
    :designers {:type (non-null (list :Designer))
                :description "Designers who contributed to the game."
                :resolve :BoardGame/designers}
    :min_players {:type Int
                  :description "The minimum number of players the game supports."}
    :max_players {:type Int
                  :description "The maximum number of players the game supports."}
    :play_time {:type Int
                :description "Play time, in minutes, for a typical game."}}}

  :Designer
  {:description "A person who may have contributed to a board game design."
   :fields
   {:id {:type (non-null ID)}
    :name {:type (non-null String)}
    :url {:type String
          :description "Home page URL, if known."}
    :games {:type (non-null (list :BoardGame))
            :description "Games designed by this designer."
            :resolve :Designer/games}}}}

 :queries
 {:game_by_id
  {:type :BoardGame
   :description "Access a BoardGame by its unique id, if it exists."
   :args
   {:id {:type ID}}
   :resolve :query/game-by-id}}}
#+END_SRC

Now we are missing a resolver!

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :wrap "SRC clojure :noeval" :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/
(use 'user :reload-all) ; to reload all the ns
(q "{ game_by_id(id: \"1237\") {designers}}")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :noeval
{:errors [{:message "Exception applying arguments to field `game_by_id': For argument `id', clojure.spec.alpha$spec_impl$reify__48448 cannot be cast to clojure.lang.IFn", :query-path [], :locations [{:line 1, :column 0}], :field :game_by_id, :argument :id}]}class clojure.lang.Compiler$CompilerExceptionclass clojure.lang.Compiler$CompilerExceptionCompilerException clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo: Resolver specified in schema not provided. {:reference :BoardGame/designers, :callbacks (:query/game-by-id)}, compiling:(user.clj:8:13) 
#+END_SRC

Let's define the designer resolver:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/src/lacinia_tutorial/schema.clj
(ns lacinia-tutorial.schema
  "Contains custom resolvers and a function to provide the full schema."
  (:require
    [clojure.java.io :as io]
    [com.walmartlabs.lacinia.util :as util]
    [com.walmartlabs.lacinia.schema :as schema]
    [clojure.edn :as edn]))

(defn resolve-game-by-id
  [games-map context args value] ; the last 3 attributes are provided by the resolver
  (let [{:keys [id]} args]
    (get games-map id)))

(defn resolve-board-game-designers
  [designers-map context args board-game]
  (->> board-game
       :designers
       (map designers-map)))

(defn resolve-designer-games
  [games-map context args designer]
  (let [{:keys [id]} designer]
    (->> games-map
         vals
         (filter #(-> % :designers (contains? id))))))

(defn entity-map
  [data k]
  (reduce #(assoc %1 (:id %2) %2)
          {}
          (get data k)))

(defn resolver-map
  []
  (let [cgg-data (-> (io/resource "cgg-data.edn")
                     slurp
                     edn/read-string)
        games-map (entity-map cgg-data :games)
        designers-map (entity-map cgg-data :designers)]
    {:query/game-by-id (partial resolve-game-by-id games-map)
     :BoardGame/designers (partial resolve-board-game-designers designers-map)
     :Designer/games (partial resolve-designer-games games-map)}))

(defn load-schema
  []
  (-> (io/resource "cgg-schema.edn") ;; load text from resource directory
      slurp
      edn/read-string ;; get the data as a clojure object
      (util/attach-resolvers (resolver-map)) ;; apply the resolver
      schema/compile)) ;; this should produce the GraphQL api?

#+END_SRC

And now a nested query: 

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :wrap "SRC clojure :noeval" :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/
(use 'user :reload-all) ; to reload all the ns
(q "{ game_by_id(id: \"1237\") { name designers { name }}}")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :noeval
nil{:data {:game_by_id {:name "7 Wonders: Duel", :designers [{:name "Antoine Bauza"} {:name "Bruno Cathala"}]}}}
#+END_SRC

Now queries need to be nested otherwise we get an error:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :wrap "SRC clojure :noeval" :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/
(use 'user :reload-all) ; to reload all the ns
(q "{ game_by_id(id: \"1237\") { name designers }}")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :noeval
nil{:errors [{:message "Field `designers' (of type `Designer') must have at least one selection.", :locations [{:line 1, :column 25}]}]}
#+END_SRC

And since we have defined an isomorphism between the data (from
designer to board and viz), we can show the graph side of this query
language:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :wrap "SRC clojure :noeval" :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/
(use 'user :reload-all) ; to reload all the ns
(q "{ game_by_id(id: \"1234\") { name designers { name games { name }}}}") ;; this query uses the isomorphism
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :noeval
nil{:data {:game_by_id {:name "Zertz", :designers [{:name "Kris Burm", :games [{:name "Zertz"}]}]}}}
#+END_SRC

Now that we have a working REPL, let's move on to the web interface:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/project.clj
(defproject clojure-game-geek "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "A tiny BoardGameGeek clone written in Clojure with Lacinia"
  :url "https://github.com/walmartlabs/clojure-game-geek"
  :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"
            :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.8.0"]
                 [com.walmartlabs/lacinia-pedestal "0.5.0"]
                 [io.aviso/logging "0.2.0"]])
#+END_SRC

=lacinia-pedestal= is the web layer based on jetty.
We can now setup logging with a Logback library configuration file:

#+BEGIN_SRC xml :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/dev-resources/logback-test.xml
<configuration scan="true" scanPeriod="1 seconds">

  <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
    <encoder>
      <pattern>%-5level %logger - %msg%n</pattern>
    </encoder>
  </appender>

  <root level="warn">
    <appender-ref ref="STDOUT"/>
  </root>

</configuration>
#+END_SRC

And now let's improve our REPL development tools:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/dev-resources/user.clj
(ns user
  (:require
    [lacinia-tutorial.schema :as s]
    [com.walmartlabs.lacinia :as lacinia]
    [com.walmartlabs.lacinia.pedestal :as lp]
    [io.pedestal.http :as http]
    [clojure.java.browse :refer [browse-url]]
    [clojure.walk :as walk])
  (:import (clojure.lang IPersistentMap)))

(def schema (s/load-schema))

(defn simplify
  "Converts all ordered maps nested within the map into standard hash maps, and
   sequences into vectors, which makes for easier constants in the tests, and eliminates ordering problems."
  [m]
  (walk/postwalk
    (fn [node]
      (cond
        (instance? IPersistentMap node)
        (into {} node)

        (seq? node)
        (vec node)

        :else
        node))
    m))

(defn q
  [query-string]
  (-> (lacinia/execute schema query-string nil nil)
      simplify))

(defonce server nil)

(defn start-server
  [_]
  (let [server (-> schema
                   (lp/service-map {:graphiql true})
                   http/create-server
                   http/start)]
    (browse-url "http://localhost:8888/")
    server))

(defn stop-server
  [server]
  (http/stop server)
  nil)

(defn start
  []
  (alter-var-root #'server start-server)
  :started)

(defn stop
  []
  (alter-var-root #'server stop-server)
  :stopped)
#+END_SRC

We have enabled graphiql to have at disposal the interactive REPL of
GraphQL. This should not be enabled in PRD.

Now we can start the server:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/ 
(start)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:

The GraphIQL interface is cool: the Docs button is very useful to
explore the schema available.

Let's handle state with the component library:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/project.clj
(defproject clojure-game-geek "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "A tiny BoardGameGeek clone written in Clojure with Lacinia"

  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.8.0"]
                 [com.walmartlabs/lacinia-pedestal "0.5.0"]
                 [com.stuartsierra/component "0.3.2"]
                 [io.aviso/logging "0.2.0"]])
#+END_SRC

We will have two component: the server and the schema provider. We
know that the server depends on the schema provider (no schema no
party XD).

The schema provider:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/src/lacinia_tutorial/schema.clj
(ns lacinia-tutorial.schema
  "Contains custom resolvers and a function to provide the full schema."
  (:require
    [clojure.java.io :as io]
    [com.walmartlabs.lacinia.util :as util]
    [com.walmartlabs.lacinia.schema :as schema]
    [com.stuartsierra.component :as component]
    [clojure.edn :as edn]))

(defn resolve-game-by-id
  [games-map context args value]
  (let [{:keys [id]} args]
    (get games-map id)))

(defn resolve-board-game-designers
  [designers-map context args board-game]
  (->> board-game
       :designers
       (map designers-map)))

(defn resolve-designer-games
  [games-map context args designer]
  (let [{:keys [id]} designer]
    (->> games-map
         vals
         (filter #(-> % :designers (contains? id))))))

(defn entity-map
  [data k]
  (reduce #(assoc %1 (:id %2) %2)
          {}
          (get data k)))

(defn resolver-map
  [component] ; now this function depends on a component
  (let [cgg-data (-> (io/resource "cgg-data.edn")
                     slurp
                     edn/read-string)
        games-map (entity-map cgg-data :games)
        designers-map (entity-map cgg-data :designers)]
    {:query/game-by-id (partial resolve-game-by-id games-map)
     :BoardGame/designers (partial resolve-board-game-designers designers-map)
     :Designer/games (partial resolve-designer-games games-map)}))

(defn load-schema
  [component]
  (-> (io/resource "cgg-schema.edn")
      slurp
      edn/read-string
      (util/attach-resolvers (resolver-map component))
      schema/compile))

(defrecord SchemaProvider [schema]

  component/Lifecycle

  (start [this]
    (assoc this :schema (load-schema this))) ; a record can override methods

  (stop [this]
    (assoc this :schema nil)))

(defn new-schema-provider ;; a constructor for the SchemaProvider
  []
  {:schema-provider (map->SchemaProvider {})})
#+END_SRC

And the server component:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/src/lacinia_tutorial/server.clj
(ns lacinia-tutorial.server
  (:require [com.stuartsierra.component :as component]
            [com.walmartlabs.lacinia.pedestal :as lp]
            [io.pedestal.http :as http]))

(defrecord Server [schema-provider server] ; this is what we had in the user.clj before

  component/Lifecycle
  (start [this]
    (assoc this :server (-> schema-provider
                            :schema
                            (lp/service-map {:graphiql true})
                            http/create-server
                            http/start)))

  (stop [this]
    (http/stop server)
    (assoc this :server nil)))

(defn new-server
  []
  {:server (component/using (map->Server {})   ;; here the dependency on the :schema-provider component
                            [:schema-provider])})

#+END_SRC

And to have a high level view of the components:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/src/lacinia_tutorial/system.clj
(ns lacinia-tutorial.system
  (:require
    [com.stuartsierra.component :as component]
    [lacinia-tutorial.schema :as schema]
    [lacinia-tutorial.server :as server]))

(defn new-system
  []
  (merge (component/system-map)
         (server/new-server)
         (schema/new-schema-provider)))
#+END_SRC

Finally the user.clj has to change:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/dev-resources/user.clj
(ns user
  (:require
    [com.walmartlabs.lacinia :as lacinia]
    [clojure.java.browse :refer [browse-url]]
    [lacinia-tutorial.system :as system]
    [clojure.walk :as walk]
    [com.stuartsierra.component :as component])
  (:import (clojure.lang IPersistentMap)))

(defn simplify
  "Converts all ordered maps nested within the map into standard hash maps, and
   sequences into vectors, which makes for easier constants in the tests, and eliminates ordering problems."
  [m]
  (walk/postwalk
    (fn [node]
      (cond
        (instance? IPersistentMap node)
        (into {} node)

        (seq? node)
        (vec node)

        :else
        node))
    m))

(defonce system (system/new-system))

(defn q
  [query-string]
  (-> system ; here we are deconstructing our system
      :schema-provider
      :schema
      (lacinia/execute query-string nil nil)
      simplify))

(defn start
  []
  (alter-var-root #'system component/start-system) ; here we change our system atom
  (browse-url "http://localhost:8888/")
  :started)

(defn stop
  []
  (alter-var-root #'system component/stop-system)
  :stopped)
#+END_SRC

And it works:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/
(start)
#+END_SRC

:END:

We are missing some information from our data schema that could be

#+END_SRC

Let's try:

#+END_SRC

The cool thing about GraphQL is that it allows to modify data as well!
So far our resolvers were just reading data. In GraphQL a mutation
allows to alter existing data. We will need to set up a mutable data
structure: a database!

A database is another component: our schema provider will depend on
it.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/src/lacinia_tutorial/db.clj
(ns lacinia-tutorial.db
  (:require
    [clojure.edn :as edn]
    [clojure.java.io :as io]
    [com.stuartsierra.component :as component]))

(defrecord ClojureGameGeekDb [data]

  component/Lifecycle

  (start [this]
    (assoc this :data (-> (io/resource "cgg-data.edn")
                          slurp
                          edn/read-string
                          atom)))

  (stop [this]
    (assoc this :data nil)))

(defn new-db
  []
  {:db (map->ClojureGameGeekDb {})})

(defn find-game-by-id
  [db game-id]
  (->> db
       :data
       deref
       :games
       (filter #(= game-id (:id %)))
       first))

(defn find-member-by-id
  [db member-id]
  (->> db
       :data
       deref
       :members
       (filter #(= member-id (:id %)))
       first))

(defn list-designers-for-game
  [db game-id]
  (let [designers (:designers (find-game-by-id db game-id))]
    (->> db
         :data
         deref
         :designers
         (filter #(contains? designers (:id %))))))

(defn list-games-for-designer
  [db designer-id]
  (->> db
       :data
       deref
       :games
       (filter #(-> % :designers (contains? designer-id)))))

(defn list-ratings-for-game
  [db game-id]
  (->> db
       :data
       deref
       :ratings

  [db member-id]
  (->> db
       :data
       deref
       :ratings
       (filter #(= member-id (:member_id %)))))
#+END_SRC

We essentially just embed the db in a component. Notice the :data
atom: this is our mutable data strucutre.

Again the system will change:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/src/lacinia_tutorial/system.clj
(ns lacinia-tutorial.system
  (:require
    [com.stuartsierra.component :as component]
    [lacinia-tutorial.schema :as schema]
    [lacinia-tutorial.server :as server]

         (server/new-server)
         (schema/new-schema-provider)
         (db/new-db)))
#+END_SRC

Now we have to enforce the dependency on the schema provider:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/src/lacinia_tutorial/schema.clj
(ns lacinia-tutorial.schema
  "Contains custom resolvers and a function to provide the full schema."

     :GameRating/game (game-rating->game db)

      slurp
      edn/read-string

#+END_SRC

Now we can test our GraphQL again:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :wrap "SRC clojure :noeval" :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/

(q "{ member_by_id(id: \"1410\") { member_name ratings { game { name rating_summary { count average } designers { name  games { name }}} rating }}}")

#+END_SRC

=resolve-as= should return =nil= with errors.

Let's try out our first mutation. We first read the data:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :wrap "SRC clojure :noeval" :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/
(start)
(q "{ member_by_id(id: \"1410\") { member_name ratings { game { id name } rating }}}")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :noeval
:started{:data {:member_by_id {:member_name "bleedingedge", :ratings [{:game {:id "1234", :name "Zertz"}, :rating 5} {:game {:id "1236", :name "Tiny Epic Galaxies"}, :rating 4} {:game {:id "1237", :name "7 Wonders: Duel"}, :rating 4}]}}}
#+END_SRC

Then we modify the data:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :wrap "SRC clojure :noeval" :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/
(q "mutation { rate_game(member_id: \"1410\", game_id: \"1236\", rating: 3) { rating_summary { count average }}}")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :noeval
{:data {:rate_game {:rating_summary {:count 1, :average 3.0}}}}
#+END_SRC

And we check that the result was persisted:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :wrap "SRC clojure :noeval" :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/
(q "{ member_by_id(id: \"1410\") { member_name ratings { game { id name } rating }}}")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :noeval
{:data {:member_by_id {:member_name "bleedingedge", :ratings [{:game {:id "1236", :name "Tiny Epic Galaxies"}, :rating 3} {:game {:id "1234", :name "Zertz"}, :rating 5} {:game {:id "1237", :name "7 Wonders: Duel"}, :rating 4}]}}}
#+END_SRC

Also let's note the difference between an expected error

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :wrap "SRC clojure :noeval" :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/
(q "mutation { rate_game(member_id: \"1410\", game_id: \"9999\", rating: 4) { name rating_summary { count average }}}")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :noeval
{:data {:rate_game nil}, :errors [{:message "Game not found.", :status 404, :locations [{:line 1, :column 9}], :query-path [:rate_game], :arguments {:member_id "1410", :game_id "9999", :rating "4"}}]}
#+END_SRC

and an unexpected one:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :wrap "SRC clojure :noeval" :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/
(q "mutation { rate_game(member_id: \"1410\", game_id: \"9999\") { name rating_summary { count average }}}")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :noeval
{:errors [{:message "Exception applying arguments to field `rate_game': Not all non-nullable arguments have supplied values.", :query-path [], :locations [{:line 1, :column 9}], :field :rate_game, :missing-arguments [:rating]}]}
#+END_SRC

After all of this mutating, we really should think about a serious
database. Let's use PostgreSQL!

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/project.clj
(defproject clojure-game-geek "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "A tiny BoardGameGeek clone written in Clojure with Lacinia"
  :url "https://github.com/walmartlabs/clojure-game-geek"
  :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"
            :url "http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html"}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.9.0"]
                 [com.stuartsierra/component "0.3.2"]
                 [com.walmartlabs/lacinia "0.30.0"]
                 [com.walmartlabs/lacinia-pedestal "0.10.0"]
                 [org.clojure/java.jdbc "0.7.8"]
                 [org.postgresql/postgresql "42.2.5.jre7"]
                 [com.mchange/c3p0 "0.9.5.2"]
                 [io.aviso/logging "0.3.1"]])
#+END_SRC

=jdbc= is our wrapper to connect with database. =c3p0= will care about
grouping our connections efficiently. =postgresql= will provide a
wrapper to communicate with the db.

Let's setup the docker environment that will guest our DB:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  db:
    ports:
    - 25432:5432
    image: postgres:10.2-alpine
#+END_SRC

A script to start docker will simplify matters:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :shebang :mkdirp yes :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/bin/docker-up.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

docker-compose -p cgg up -d
#+END_SRC

And one to stop docker:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :shebang :mkdirp yes :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/bin/docker-down.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

docker-compose -p cgg down
#+END_SRC

And another to start a sql shell from the container:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :shebang :mkdirp yes :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/bin/psql.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

docker exec -ti --user postgres cgg_db_1 psql -Ucgg_role cggdb
#+END_SRC

And a final one to fill the DB within the container:


#+BEGIN_SRC sh :shebang :mkdirp yes :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/bin/setup-db.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

docker exec -i --user postgres cgg_db_1 createdb cggdb

docker exec -i --user postgres cgg_db_1 psql cggdb -a  <<__END

Note kebab case is invalid in GraphQL schema. Note: JDBC defaults to a
connection for operation. This is why we use an external library to
handle pooling.

We basically setup pooling in the start of the component, and we
modify our code that retrieved data to query these through SQL.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/bin/
./docker-up.sh; ./setup-db.sh./docker-up.sh
#+END_SRC

Now let's try again our query:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :wrap "SRC clojure :noeval" :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/
(start)
(q "{ game_by_id(id: 1234) { game_id name summary min_players max_players }}")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :noeval
{:data {:game_by_id {:game_id 1234, :name "Zertz", :summary "Two player abstract with forced moves and shrinking board", :min_players 2, :max_players 2}}}
#+END_SRC

Let's improve the user.clj:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/dev-resources/user.clj

#+END_SRC

Let's harder what we got with some tests.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/src/lacinia_tutorial/server.clj
(ns lacinia-tutorial.server
  (:require [com.stuartsierra.component :as component]
            [com.walmartlabs.lacinia.pedestal :as lp]

(defrecord Server [schema-provider server port] ; this is what we had in the user.clj before

  component/Lifecycle
  (start [this]
    (assoc this :server (-> schema-provider
                            :schema

  {:server (component/using (map->Server {:port 8888})
                            [:schema-provider])})

#+END_SRC

This is enough configuration to configure a different server port for
tests.

Then we extract utility functions:

#+END_SRC

And let's add an integration test:

(defn ^:private q

      simplify))

(deftest can-read-board-game

           results))
    (component/stop-system system)))
#+END_SRC

And let's run the test:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output :dir /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/
rm /tmp/lacinia-tutorial/test/lacinia_tutorial/core_test.clj
lein test
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:

:END:

And with this we have seen a lot of what we can do with Lacinia!
